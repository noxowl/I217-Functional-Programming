# I217: Functional Programming
## 4. Parameterized Modules
### Exercises
1. Write all programs in the slides including the appendices and feed them into the CafeOBJ system. Moreover, write some more test code and do some more testing for the programs.
2. Revise the programs used in the slides such that binary‐ search trees are used instead of lists.
3. Write a program of balanced binary search trees based on the following: Arne Andersson: Balanced Search Trees Made Simple. WADS 1993: 60‐71 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3‐540‐57155‐8_236
4. Write a program that finds the shortest path on a directed weighted graph based on the Dijkstra shortest path finding algorithm.
5. Write a program that finds the shortest path on a directed weighted graph based on A*, an extended version of the Dijkstra shortest path finding algorithm.
6. Write a program that finds the shortest path on a directed weighted graph based on LPA* (Lifelong Planning A*), an incremental version of A*. See the following: Sven Koenig, Maxim Likhachev: D*Lite. AAAI/IAAI 2002: 476‐ 483 https://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2002/aaai02-072.php
7. Implement all data structures and algorithms you have learned so far in your life.
