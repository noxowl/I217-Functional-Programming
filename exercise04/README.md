# I217: Functional Programming
## 4. Parameterized Modules
### Exercises
1. Type each module used in the slides and some test code (enclosed with open and close) in one file and feed it into the CafeOBJ system.
2. Write a parametrized module in which the generic merge sort is described and some test code for lists of natural numbers, lists of strings, lists of lists of natural numbers and lists of lists of strings.
3. Write a parametrized module in which the generic bubble sort is described and some test code for lists of natural numbers, lists of strings, lists of lists of natural numbers and lists of lists of strings.
4. Write a parametrized module in which the generic insertion sort is described and some test code for lists of natural numbers, lists of strings, lists of lists of natural numbers and lists of lists of strings.
5. Write a parametrized module in which the generic selection sort is described and some test code for lists of natural numbers, lists of strings, lists of lists of natural numbers and lists of lists of strings.
6. Modern programming languages are equipped with what corresponds to parametrized modules, such as functors of Standard ML and templates of C++. Investigate them and make a comparison of parameterized modules with them.
7. Parameterized modules can be used to partially implement what can be done by higher‚Äêorder functions. Investigate it and write some examples in CafeOBJ. See the following: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/pps/utyop.pdf
8. Terms can be defined in terms of operators in CafeJOBJ, which needs to use parameterized modules, and term rewriting can be implemented in CafeOBJ. Do them. See the following: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/338407.338558
9. Modules including parameterized ones can be defined in terms of operators in CafeJOBJ. Do this and implement some functions with which modules can be handled. This has something to do with reflective (or meta) programming. See the following: https://maude.lcc.uma.es/maude30-manual-html/maude-manual.html, especially Chapter 17.
10. The theoretical background of parameterized module is Theory of Institution. Investigate Theory of Institution, for example, by reading the following paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/147508.147524 Note that you need to learn Category Theory to understand Theory of Institution.
11. Theory of Institution can be used to describe logics. Investigate how to use Theory of Institutions to describe logics.
