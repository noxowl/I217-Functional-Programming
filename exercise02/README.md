# I217: Functional Programming
## 2. Modules, Order Sorts & Lists of Natural Numbers
### Exercises
1. Type each module used in the slides and some test code (enclosed with open and close) in one file and feed it into the CafeOBJ system.
2. Write a module for each piece of programs used in lecture note 1 and some test code in one file and feed it into the CafeOBJ system. Among those modules are FACT & OEDC- FACT.
3. Write a module in which a function that performs the merge sort is defined and some test code in one file and feed it into the CafeOBJ system.
4. Write a module in which a function that performs the bubble sort is defined and some test code in one file and feed it into the CafeOBJ system.
5. Write a module in which a function that performs the insertion sort is defined and some test code in one file and feed it into the CafeOBJ system.
6. Write a module in which a function that performs the selection sort is defined and some test code in one file and feed it into the CafeOBJ system.
7. Write a module in which a function that solves the Hamming’s problem is defined and some test code in one file and feed it into the CafeOBJ system. The Hamming’s problem is as follows. Given a number _n_, make the following list of natural numbers.
    1. Each element of the list is less than or equal to _n_.
    2. If _n_ = 0, the list is nil; if _n_ ≥ 1, the first element of the list is 1.
    3. If the list contains _x_, it also contains 2\*_x_, 3\*_x_ and 5\*_x_, provided that they are less than or equal to _n_.
    4. Each number occurs in the list at most once.
    5. The list is in increasing order.
8. Arrays available in many existing programming languages, such as C, are similar to lists but not exactly the same as lists. Investigate the essence of arrays and the essential difference between arrays and lists.
9. Investigate how to deal with arrays in Math (including how to define arrays in Math).
